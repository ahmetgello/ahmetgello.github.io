		<h3>First of All</h3>

		hello it's gelo and welcome to my new website. <br>
		it's empty ik. <br>
		i'm gonna put stuff here probably. <br>
		one day... <br>

		<br>
		<br>
		
		oh it's next day let's write..
		<h3>About me</h3>

		my name is Ahmet Kallo, ahmetgello, or simply gelo. <br> <br>

		(gosh i need to learn how to html this website) <br>
		So I'm 18 years old and I'll turn 19 in January 2025. <br>
		I always have big goals in whatever I work on. <br>
		I have worked on projects that I'm proud of, <br>
		basically, I'm proud of doing stuff and not the outcomes. <br>
		I mean by doing things since I was a kid I learnt a lot. <br> <br>

		The stuff that I have built are mostly games, <br>
		because I'm as every other young person in todays world <br>
		someone that likes to play video games. <br>
		In the future I would like to build more than games <br>
		But let me build impressive games first. <br> <br>

		<h3>Projects</h3>
		About 3 years ago, <br>
		I made a game for my favourite youtuber at the time: <br>
		<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AhmetKallo.BanderitaXGame">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AhmetKallo.BanderitaXGame</a> <br>
		It's a 2D platformer and puzzle game. <br>
		My goal was that the youtuber would play it. <br>
		He didn't, and I didn't push throw it. <br>
		The game reached 28k downloads, it has 2k active players. <br>
		I'm updating the game, to grow it and learn more. <br> <br>


		About 2 years ago, <br>
		I made a game for another youtuber. <br>
		(I think I liked watching youtube) <br>
		This time I sent 2 emails to 2 youtubers about making a game for them. <br>
		One of them responded and liked the idea. <br>
		I made him a game similar to the previous one <br>
		with different puzzle and funny ideas. <br>
		I didn't publish the game. <br>
		It was just for him, and for me to learn. <br>
		Here is his video on the game: <br>
		<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=s79lXA6rm8s">http://youtube.com/watch?v=s79lXA6rm8s</a> <br>

		<h3>Exploration</h3>
		After that game, <br>
		I wanted to make friends, communicate, and attend events. <br>
		I knew that I lacked communication skills, and that I needed to explore entrepreneurship around me in Istanbul. <br>
		I saw young entrepreneurial groups on social media, <br>
		and I went to the first one feeling stressful. <br>
		After that, I made some great friends, <br>
		I got to know maybe every incubation center, and similar places. <br>
		I joined 2 young teams KidLab and T4 Technology Team. <br>
		I worked with them as a game developer, <br>
		and we went maybe to every game jam, hackathon, or event in Istanbul. <br>
		KidLab got the first in EdTech category in TEKNOFEST. <br>
		T4 Technology Team's project got first in a hackathon MetaHack. <br>
		I'm proud. <br>

		<h3>The Future</h3>
		I think I got a good idea about entrepreneurship and games throughout my journey. <br>
		Today, I'm improving my past projects, <br>
		and I will make a great project next. <br>

		<h3>What Do I Want To Share Here?</h3>
		I want to improve my writing. <br>
		I want to explain technical things that I know and aren't out there. <br>
		I want to make an audience or a personal space on the internet. <br>

		<h3>Stuff I Like</h3>
		Unconsciously, I tend to watch and read about technology and great people. <br>
		Recently, I have been reading <a href="https://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>'s essays.<br>
		For a while I followed <a href="https://geohot.com">George Hotz</a>. <br>
		I get to know great things and great people from <a href="https://lexfridman.com">Lex Fridman</a>'s podcast. <br>
I want to read <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com">Sam Altman</a>'s blogs. <br>

		<h3>Social Media</h3>
		I don't use social media much and want to reduce my time more. <br>
		But, here are the stuff if you care. <br>
		<a href="https://instagram.com/ahmetgello">Instagram</a> <br>
		<a href="https://youtube.com/@ahmetgello">Old Youtube Volgs</a> <br>
		<a href="https://youtube.com/@geloFN">Fortnite Youtube</a> <br>
		<a href="https://github.com/ahmetgello">Github</a> <br>
		<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/gello">LinkedIn</a> <br>

		<br>

		People probably have their own things and life to care about. <br>
		So, if you read this thank you. <br>
		Have a nice day. <br> <br>

		I'm translating Paul Graham essays just as a hobby and to learn. <br>
